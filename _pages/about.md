My name is Peiyu Zhou. I am a senior undergraduate student at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**.

My primary research interest lies in **unsupervised single-cell multi-omics clustering**.

This website is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. Here you can find more about my research, projects, and academic activities.
